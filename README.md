# Finance_DashBoard_With_Expense_Tracker
This project introduces a user-friendly dashboard for efficient expense tracking, providing insightful yearly and category-based graphs. The primary implementation is in Python, utilizing SQLite3 for database management, and integrating Flask and Dash for web framework functionalities.

To initiate the main program, finance.py, run one.py beforehand. one.py is responsible for database creation and table setup using SQLite3. Hence, it's essential to establish the database structure before executing the main program.

finance.py encompasses the core functionality, incorporating Flask and Dash for the web interface, SQLite for data storage, and Pandas for advanced analysis and calculations.
For database maintenance, two.py offers functionalities to delete specific IDs from the database or modify it to clear the entire table if required.
